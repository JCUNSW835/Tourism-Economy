            # of new pages with emplates

# the below line is using a Python decorator- and this wraps a functions and modifies its behaviour
# sungle/below can be thought of as the 'base URL'
# specifying how to handle a particular URL request
# / is the default base URL

    # index.html is very common naming convention for the 'base'/
    # 'first' HTML file that should be homepage.
# so within a single site, we can have multiple 'sub routes' - e.g pages
# examples
# www.google.com
# wwww.google.com/images
# www.google.com/signin/authenticator etc

# boilerplate code that protects users from invoking the script
# when they didn't necessarily mean to
# More broadly: as we start to work with mutiple Python filesï¼Œ
# and import functions from other files, it's important
